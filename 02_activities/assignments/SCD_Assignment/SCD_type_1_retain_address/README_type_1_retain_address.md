# Type 1 SCD: Retain Address History

In a Type 1 Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD), each address change is recorded as a **new row**, preserving the entire history of a customerâ€™s addresses.

## Table Structure

- **CustomerAddresses_Type1**
  - `address_id` (PK, auto-increment) 
  - `customer_id` (FK to `Customer`)
  - `address_line1`, `address_line2`, `city`, `state`, `zip_code`
  - `effective_start_date`
  - `effective_end_date` (NULL if currently active)

A single customer can have **multiple address rows** over time. Each row covers a distinct date range.
